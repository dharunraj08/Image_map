    The NLC mine, managed by Neyveli Lignite Corporation, is one of the largest open-cast lignite mines in India. It extracts lignite, a type of brown coal, which is used for power generation in Neyveli’s thermal power stations. The mine supports thousands of workers and contributes greatly to India’s energy needs. It is an important center for industrial growth and energy production in Tamil Nadu.
